Classes
We use classes to define new types.
class Point:
 def __init__(self, x, y):
 self.x = x
 self.y = y
 def move(self):
 print(“move”) 

When a function is part of a class, we refer to it as a method.
Classes define templates or blueprints for creating objects. An object is an instance
of a class. Every time we create a new instance, that instance follows the structure
we define using the class.
point1 = Point(10, 5)
point2 = Point(2, 4)
__init__ is a special method called constructor. It gets called at the time of
creating new objects. We use it to initialize our objects.
